## Gameplay

Need to make some gameplay :P.

### Less shooting

 * Focus on melee combat
 * A melee engagement should be based on stamina/skill
 * High skill makes enemy's stamina decrease faster
 * When a character's stamina is gone, they take a blow
 * Blows are often deadly

### Mage

 * Healing spell
 * Magic missile
 * Possible: missile takes time to recharge... how long?
 * Possible: missile prevents healing for some time

## Environment

 * Less waist-high-walls because less shooting
 * Arena-based?
 * Build custom arenas in Blender
 * Arrange arenas in random linear order
 * State machine to lay arenas out with rules

## Commands

 * Help/heal: mage will cast healing spell, fighters will do what?
